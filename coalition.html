                        To build support from across the county or region for new local tax revenue you need to make sure every key voving group or area sees something that matches their needs. Many potential supporters will not ride new transit, but will still benefit from the economic development, traffic mitigation, and expanded access to jobs that transit provides the region.

                        It is often assumed that building support for transportation funding across a region depends on combining transit and highway projects into a single package. <a href="http://transitcenter.org/2016/11/09/mixed-highwaytransit-ballots-tank-at-polls/" target="_blank">Recent results <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> have shown that transit can win support on its own, and these combined packages may turn away more supporters than they attract

                    <p>
                        When building support for a local project, such as a bus route change or new bus lane, it is important to work with local businesses and community leaders from the outset and address local concerns. Vocal, narrow opposition can easily outweigh broad benefits of these projects and local expertise can improve these projects. For example, in Nashville opposition to a proposed bus corridor focused in on the way the new bus lane would disrupt left turns from car lanes (an argument that is <a href="https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/dont-feel-too-bad-nashville-even-new-york-city-cant-handle-real-brt" target="_blank">not at all unusual <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>. In planning new routes for regional transit, business leaders have proactively engaged with community and local leaders an win buy-in from the outset.

                                    California law requries a two-thirds supermajority on referenda to approve new local taxes. Winning that level of support for new transit - across a large, diverse county that is nationally known as the center of car culture - required a major coalition led by <a href="http://www.movela.org/about_us" target="_blank">Move LA <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.
